        <h4 style="color: green;">The Emu War- Oversimplification by Oversimplified <br>
           <span style="font-weight: lighter;">This is Australia. For the man who imagines being strangled by a tarantual while a kangaroo breaks his kneecaps and thinks, mmmm yes please. <br>
                                               For the man who pictures himself being eaten by a snake in the burning out back while eating a Begimite sandwich and thinks mmmmmmmm yes please <br>
